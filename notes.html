<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-1">
<p>
Looking back to the last half century of computer technologies and architectures, one may observe a trend of fluctuation between the centralization and subsequent decentralization of computing power, storage, infrastructure, protocols, and code.
</p>

<p>
Mainframe computers are largely centralized. They typically house all computing power, memory, data storage, and code. Access to mainframes is mainly by 'dumb terminals', which only take inputs and outputs, and do not store or process data.
</p>

<p>
With the advent of personal computers and private networks, similar computational capabilities were now housed both on the clients, as well as the servers. This, in part, gave rise to the 'client-server' architecture, which supported the development of relational database systems. Massive data sets, which are housed on mainframes, could move onto a distributed architecture. This data could replicate from server to server, and subsets of the data could be accessed and processed on clients, and then, synced back to the server.
</p>

<p>
Over time, Internet and cloud computing architectures enabled global access from a variety of computing devices; whereas mainframes were largely designed to address the needs of large corporations and governments. Even though this 'cloud architecture' is decentralized in terms of hardware, it has given rise to application-level centralization (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc).
</p>

<p>
Currently, we are witnessing the transition from centralized computing, storage, and processing to decentralized architectures and systems. According to <a href="https://medium.com/@muneeb/the-next-wave-of-computing-743295b4bc73">Muneeb Ali</a>, these systems aim to
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"give explicit control of digital assets to end-users and remove the need to trust any third-party servers and infrastructure".
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Distributed ledger technology is one of the key innovations making this shift possible.

<h4 id="sec-4-1-2"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.2</span> Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-2">
<p>
A <b>distributed ledger</b> is a type of data structure which resides across multiple computer devices, generally spread across locations or regions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Distributed Ledger Technology</b> includes blockchain technologies and smart contracts. While distributed ledgers existed prior to Bitcoin, the Bitcoin blockchain marks the convergence of a host of technologies, including timestamping of transactions, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, cryptography, and shared computational power, along with a new consensus algorithm. 
</p>

<p>
In summary, distributed ledger technology generally consists of <a href="https://intelledger.github.io/introduction.html">three basic components</a>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A <b>data model</b> that captures the current state of the ledger
</li>
<li>A <b>language of transactions</b> that changes the ledger state
</li>
<li>A <b>protocol</b> used to build consensus among participants around which transactions will be accepted, and in what order, by the ledger.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-1-3"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.3</span> Blockchains</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-3">
<p>
According to <a href="https://hyperledger.org/about">hyperledger.org</a>,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"A blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger forged by consensus, combined with a system for "smart contracts" and other assistive technologies."
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Smart contracts</b> are simply computer programs that execute predefined actions when certain conditions within the system are met.
</li>

<li><b>Consensus</b> refers to a system of ensuring that parties agree to a certain state of the system as the true state.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Blockchain</b> is a specific form or subset of distributed ledger technologies, which constructs a chronological chain of <b>blocks</b>, hence the name 'block-chain'. A block refers to a set of transactions that
 are bundled together and added to the chain at the same time. In the Bitcoin blockchain, the miner nodes bundle unconfirmed and valid transactions into a block. 
Each block contains a given number of transactions. In the Bitcoin network, miners must solve a cryptographic challenge to propose the next block. This process is
 known as '<b>proof of work</b>', and requires significant computing power. We shall discuss proof of work in more detail in the Consensus Algorithms section. For a brief history of blockchain technology, please <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-brief-history-of-blockchain">click here</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Timestamping</b> is another key feature of blockchain technology. Each block is timestamped, with each new block referring to the previous block. Combined with <b>cryptographic hashes</b>, this timestamped chain of blocks provides an immutable record of all transactions in the network, from the very first (or genesis) block.
</p>

<p>
A block commonly consists of four pieces of metadata:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The reference to the previous block
</li>
<li>The proof of work, also known as a nonce
</li>
<li>The timestamp
</li>
<li>The Merkle tree root for the transactions included in this block.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1-4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-1-4"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.4</span> Merkle Tree</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-4">
<p>
The Merkle tree, also known as a binary hash tree, is a data structure that is used to store hashes of the individual data in large datasets in a way to make the verification of the dataset efficient. 
It is an <b>anti-tamper mechanism</b> to ensure that the large dataset has not been changed. The word 'tree' is used to refer to a branching data structure in computer science, as seen in the image below. 
According to Andreas M. Antonopoulos, in the Bitcoin protocol,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Merkle trees are used to summarize all the transactions in a block, producing an overall digital fingerprint of the entire set of transactions, providing a very efficient process to verify whether a transaction is included in a block."
</p>

<h4 id="sec-4-1-5"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.5</span> Transactions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-5">
<p>
The record of an event, cryptographically secured with a digital signature, that is verified, ordered, and bundled together into blocks, 
form the <b>transactions</b> in the blockchain. In the Bitcoin blockchain, transactions involve the transfer of bitcoins, while in other blockchains,
transactions may involve the transfer of any asset or a record of some service being rendered. Furthermore, a smart contract
within the blockchain may allow automatic execution of transactions upon meeting predefined criteria.
</p>


<p>
<b>Cryptography</b> has a key role to play both in the security, as well as in the immutability of the transactions
 recorded on blockchains. Cryptography is the study of the techniques used to allow secure communication between different parties and to
 ensure the authenticity and immutability of the data being communicated. For blockchain technologies, cryptography is used to prove that a
 transaction was created by the right person. It is also used to link transactions into a block in a tamper-proof way, as well as create the links between blocks, to form a blockchain.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1-6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-1-6"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.6</span> Differences between Blockchains and Databases</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-6">
<p>
Blockchain technology has some key differentiators from databases. 
</p>

<p>
A blockchain is a write-only data structure, where new entries get appended onto the end of the ledger. Every
 new block gets appended to the block chain by linking to the previous block's 'hash'.
 There are no administrator permissions within a blockchain that allow editing or deleting of data.
</p>

<p>
In a relational database, data can be easily modified or deleted. Typically, there are database administrators who may make changes
 to any part of the data and/or its structure. Additionally, blockchains were designed for decentralized applications, whereas relational databases
, in general, were originally designed for centralized applications, where a single entity controls the data.

<h4 id="sec-4-1-7"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.7</span> Types of Blockchains</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-7">
<p>
A blockchain can be both <b>permissionless</b> (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) or <b>permissioned</b> (like the different Hyperledger blockchain frameworks). A permissionless
 blockchain is also known as a public blockchain, because anyone can join the network. A permissioned blockchain, or private blockchain
, requires pre-verification of the participating parties within the network, and these parties are usually known to each other.
</p>

<p>
The choice between permissionless versus permissioned blockchains should be driven by the particular application at hand (or use case). Most
 enterprise use cases involve extensive vetting before parties agree to do business with each other. An example where a number
 of businesses exchange information is the supply chain management. The supply chain management is an ideal use case for permissioned
 blockchains. You would not want non-vetted companies participating in the network. Each participant that is involved in the supply
 chain would require permissions to execute transactions on the blockchain. These transactions would allow other companies to understand where in
 the supply chain a particular item is. 
</p>

<p>
On the contrary, when a network can 'commoditize' trust, facilitating parties to transact without necessarily having to verify each other's
 identity, like the Bitcoin blockchain, a permissionless blockchain is more suitable. Many of these instances involve the sale or distribution
 to the public. Cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (which are not backed by national governments) usually involve implementations of permissionless blockchains.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1-8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-1-8"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.8</span> Peer-to-Peer Network Architecture</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-8">
<p>
Historically, most applications utilize a central server (or servers). For one user/client to send a message to another user/client
 in the network, the request has to be sent to the hub or a central server, which then directs it to the right computer.
</p>

<p>
<b>Peer-to-peer</b> (P2P) networks were first made popular by Napster (and later BitTorrent) and consist of computer systems which
 are directly connected to each other via the Internet, without a central server. Peers contribute to the computing power and
 storage that is required for the upkeep of the network. P2P networks are generally considered to be more secure than
 centralized networks, as they do not have a single point of attack, as in the case of a server-based
 network, where the security of the entire network can be compromised if the central server is successfully attacked. As a
 result, large corporations invest significant amounts of financial resources to fortify their central servers, and yet, a total cost of
 $445 billion to the global economy in cyberspace crimes was estimated by the World Economic Forum's <a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-risks-report-2016">2016 Global Risk Report</a>.
</p>

Permissionless P2P systems do not require a set amount of peers to be online and are generally slower. Permissioned P2P

<h4 id="sec-4-1-9"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.9</span> Immutability of Data</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-9">
<p>
The immutability of the data which sits on the blockchain is perhaps the most powerful and convincing reason to deploy
 blockchain-based solutions for a variety of socio-economic processes which are currently recorded on centralized servers. This <b>immutability</b>, or '<b>unchanging over time</b>' feature
 makes the blockchain useful for accounting, financial transactions, identity management, and asset ownership, management and transfer, just
 to name a few examples. Once a transaction is written onto the blockchain, no one can change it, or, at least, it would be extremely difficult to change it.
</p>

<p>
According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gentle-introduction-immutability-blockchains-antony-lewis/">Antony Lewis</a>, the Director of Research at R3, 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"When people say that blockchains are immutable, they don't mean that the data can't be changed, they mean it is extremely hard to change without collusion, and if you try, it's extremely easy to detect the attempt."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Let's dig into this statement a bit further. It is extremely hard to change the transactions in a blockchain, because
 each block is linked to the previous block by including the previous block's hash. This hash includes the Merkle root
 hash of all the transactions in the previous block. If a single transaction were to change, not only would the
 Merkle root hash change, but so too would the hash contained in the changed block. In addition, each subsequent block
 would need to be updated to reflect this change. In the case of proof of work, the amount of energy
 required to recalculate the nonce for this block and each subsequent block would be prohibitive. On the other hand, if
 someone did modify a transaction in a block without going through the necessary steps to update the subsequent blocks, it
 would be easy to recalculate the hashes used in the blocks and determine that something is amiss.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at an example of how this works. In the following diagram, we see the original blocks and the
 transactions for Block 11. Specifically, we see that the Merkle root for the transactions in Block 11 is <b>Hash #ABCD</b>, which
 is the combined hash for the four transactions in this block. Now, let's say that someone comes in and attempts
 to change Transaction A to Transaction A'. This, in turn, modifies the hashes that are stored in the Merkle tree, and the Merkle root changes to <b>Hash #A'BCD</b>.
 In addition, the Previous Block hash stored in Block 12 also needs to be modified to reflect the overall change in the hash for Block 11.

With the invention of the peer-to-peer (P2P) cash system known as Bitcoin in 2008, we have an example
 of a global decentralized payment network with a distributed and publicly-owned infrastructure, operating as a 'permissionless' system. There is
 a persuasive case that Bitcoin is the first 'killer application' of decentralized computing. One can send and receive bitcoins anywhere
 in the world in a completely P2P manner, without having to intermediate through a trusted third party, such as a bank.
</p>



<p>
According to the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">Coin Market Capitalizations</a> website, as of October 2017, bitcoin's market capitalization (market cap) was nearly $100 billion.

<p>
According to <a href="https://angel.co/blockchains">AngelList</a>, more than one thousand startups have been created to leverage Bitcoin and blockchain-related technologies since the

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-2-2">
<p>
Bitcoin has also ushered in tremendous academic and research interest in the area of Cryptoeconomics and Cryptoeconomic security.
</p>

<p>
According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKqdjaH1dRo">Vitalik Buterin</a>,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Cryptoeconomics is about building systems that have certain desired properties using cryptography to prove properties about messages that happened in
 the past while using economic incentives defined inside the system to encourage desired properties to hold into the future."
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
In other words, the field of Cryptoeconomics explores the intersection of cryptography and economic incentives. While cryptography is used for
 ensuring network security at various levels and functions, the built-in economic incentives provided to the participating nodes in the
 network ensures that, at any given point, the majority of players in the network operate in a desirable way.
</p>


<p>
Rather than imposing barriers to entry, permissionless blockchains are public and open for anyone to join. Since such networks can
 reasonably expect all kind of agents - including malicious actors - the key lies in incentivizing good behavior in a critical majority of the network, such that:
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The malicious actors cannot take over the network through an <b>escalated attack</b>.
</li>
<li>The malicious actors cannot <b>collude</b> to undertake an organized majority attack on the network.
</li>
<li>The <b>payoffs</b> of securing the network are consistently higher than the cost of attacking the network.
</li>
<li>The <b>cost</b> of attacking the network is prohibitively high.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Ethereum is an open blockchain platform that lets anyone build and use <b>decentralized applications</b> that run on blockchain technology".
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
The Ethereum blockchain platform facilitates <b>scripting functionality</b>, or '<b>smart contracts</b>', which are run through the nodes in the network. As
 a result, unlike the Bitcoin blockchain, it does not just track transactions, it also programs them. Technically, Ethereum is a
 Turing-complete virtual machine with its native cryptocurrency called 'ether'. The platform was proposed in 2013 in a white paper by the then 19-year old Vitalik Buterin.
</p>

<p>
As of October 2017, Ethereum had a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">market cap</a> of over $28 billion, making ether the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.

As the second best known public blockchain after the Bitcoin blockchain, Ethereum has ushered in an era of unprecedented activity around blockchain and distributed ledger technology.

<h4 id="sec-4-2-4"><span class="section-number-4">4.2.4</span> Dapps</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-2-4">
<p>
As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clw-qf1sUZg">Stephan Tual</a> explains, Ethereum applications do not have a middleman; instead, users interact in a P2P fashion with other
 users through a variety of interfaces - social, financial, gaming, etc. Since the applications are developed on the decentralized consensus-based
 network itself, third-party censorship is virtually impossible. Malicious actors cannot secretly tamper with the application by changing the code
 and compromise all application users (or nodes that are actively interacting with it). These <i>Decentralized Applications</i> have come to be known as <b>Dapps</b>.
</p>

<p>
Since they are cryptographically secured, Dapps are referred to as 'secure applications'. Some of the <a href="http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/web3.html">high profile Dapps</a> built on the Ethereum platform include:
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Augur</b>, which is a Decentralized Prediction Market. Learn more at <a href="https://augur.net/">https://augur.net/</a>.
</li>
<li><b>Digix</b>, which tokenizes gold on Ethereum. Learn more at: <a href="https://digix.global/">https://digix.global/</a>.
</li>
<li><b>Maker</b>, which is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Learn more at: <a href="https://makerdao.com/">https://makerdao.com/</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Ethereum network is a distributed global public network, which means it is not run on central servers in a
 certain geographical location. Instead, the computing power that runs the network is contributed by nodes that are spread across the
 globe. In other words, Dapps have 'zero downtime' - they never go down and, in general, cannot be switched off.

<h4 id="sec-4-2-5"><span class="section-number-4">4.2.5</span> Ethereum Smart Contracts</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-2-5">
<p>
A hypothetical example of an Ethereum-based smart contract may involve the following transaction: in an equity raise, transfer amount
 X from the investor to the company upon receiving the given shares from the company. The monetary amount X, which
 was pre-validated by the company for the transaction (much like in a credit card purchase), is held in escrow
 by the smart contract, until the shares have been received by the investor. Any kind of arbitrary sophisticated business logic
 can be committed to the blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain only encodes these 'rules of the games'. The actual payoffs occur by interacting with the blockchain.
</p>

<p>
The illustration below describes this process. The smart contract encodes the agreement between the company raising funds and 
its investors (Panel 1). The smart contract sits on the Ethereum public blockchain, and is run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 
Once hitting a triggering event, like an expiration date or a strike price that has been pre-coded, the smart
 contract automatically executes as per the business logic (Panel 2). As an added benefit, regulators are able to scrutinize the
 market activity on an ongoing basis, without compromising the identity of specific players in a permissionless public blockchain, as Ethereum (Panel 3).

<b>Note</b>: With the advent of the Ethereum blockchain platform and the scripting functionality or smart contracts that it enables, there

 reasons. <a href="http://www.rsk.co/">RSK</a> is one such smart contract platform that seeks to achieve this "with a 2-way peg to Bitcoin". The added functionality can
 go a long way in making the Bitcoin blockchain useful for use cases other than cash transfers.

<h3 id="sec-4-4"><span class="section-number-3">4.4</span> Consensus Algorithms</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">
<p>
<b>Consensus</b> in the network refers to the process of achieving agreement among the network participants as to the correct state
 of data on the system. Consensus leads to all nodes sharing the exact same data. A <b>consensus algorithm</b>, hence, does
 two things: it ensures that the data on the ledger is the same for all the nodes in the network
, and, in turn, prevents malicious actors from manipulating the data. The consensus algorithm varies with different blockchain implementations.
</p>

<p>
While the Bitcoin blockchain uses Proof of Work as the consensus algorithm, other blockchains and distributed ledgers are deploying a
 variety of consensus algorithms, like the Proof of Stake, Proof of Burn, Proof of Capacity, Proof of Elapsed Time, and
 many others, depending on their unique requirements.
</p>

<p>
Next, we will briefly explain some of these algorithms.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-5"><span class="section-number-3">4.5</span> Proof of Work (PoW)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-5">
<p>
The Proof of Work consensus algorithm involves solving a computational challenging puzzle in order to create new blocks in the
 Bitcoin blockchain. Colloquially, the process is known as 'mining', and the nodes in the network that engage in mining are
 known as 'miners'. The incentive for mining transactions lies in economic payoffs, where competing miners are rewarded with 12.5
 bitcoins and a small transaction fee.
</p>

<p>
As described in the <a href="https://www.kudelskisecurity.com/sites/default/files/files/kudelski_Security_blockchain_20161213.pdf">2016 Kudelski Security report</a>,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Proof-of-work (PoW) is the outcome of a successful mining process and, although the proof is hard to create, [it] is easy to verify."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For better understanding, please consider the following example provided by <a href="https://99bitcoins.com/proof-of-work-proof-of-stake/">Ofir Beigel</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"(&#x2026;) guessing a combination to a lock is a proof to a challenge. It is very hard to produce this since
 you will need to guess many different combinations; but once produced, it is easy to validate. Just enter the combination and see if the lock opens".
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Multiple criticisms exist for the PoW consensus algorithm. PoW requires a huge amount of energy to be expended, given the
 computationally heavy algorithm. In addition, PoW has a high latency of transaction validation, and the concentration of mining power is
 located in countries where electricity is cheap. In terms of the network security, PoW is susceptible to the '51% attack'
, which refers to an attack on a blockchain by a group of miners controlling more than 50% of the network's computing power.

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-6"><span class="section-number-3">4.6</span> Proof of Stake (PoS)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-6">
<p>
The Proof of Stake algorithm is a generalization of the Proof of Work algorithm. In PoS, the nodes are known
 as the 'validators' and, rather than mining the blockchain, they validate the transactions to earn a transaction fee. There is
 no mining to be done, as all coins exist from day one. Simply put, nodes are randomly selected to validate
 blocks, and the probability of this random selection depends on the amount of stake held. So, if node X owns
 2 coins and node Y owns 1 coin, node X is twice as likely to be called upon to validate
 a block of transactions. The specific implementation of PoS can vary, depending on the use case, or as a matter
 of software design. Instances include <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blockchain-consensus-algorithm-proof-of-work-satyakam-chakravarty/">Proof of Deposit</a> and <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_burn">Proof of Burn</a>. The PoS algorithm saves expensive computational resources that
 are spent in mining under a PoW consensus regime.

<p>
Developed by Intel, the Proof of Elapsed Time consensus algorithm emulates the Bitcoin-style Proof of Work. Hyperledger's Sawtooth implementation
 is an example of PoET at work. Instead of competing to solve the cryptographic challenge and mine the next block
, as in the Bitcoin blockchain, the PoET consensus algorithm is a hybrid of a random lottery and first-come-first-serve basis. In PoET, each validator is given a random wait time.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"The validator with the shortest wait time for a particular transaction block is elected the leader."

<p>
The Simplified Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm implements an adopted version of the <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/05/18/practical-byzantine-fault-tolerance/">Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant</a> (PBFT) algorithm, and
 seeks to provide significant improvements over Bitcoin's Proof of Work consensus protocol. The basic idea involves a single validator who
 bundles proposed transactions and forms a new block. Note that, unlike the Bitcoin blockchain, the validator is a known party
, given the permissioned nature of the ledger. Consensus is achieved as a result of a minimum number of other nodes
 in the network ratifying the new block. In order to be tolerant of a Byzantine fault, the number of nodes
 that must reach consensus is 2f+1 in a system containing 3f+1 nodes, where f is the number of
 faults in the system. For example, if we have 7 nodes in the system, then 5 of those nodes must
 agree if 2 of the nodes are acting in a faulty manner.
</p>

<p>
The practical example would be that of <a href="http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/08/04/byzcoin/">ByzCoin</a>, which seeks to make key improvements over the original Bitcoin protocol. Addressing
 the challenge around scalability due to high latency, ByzCoin transactions are irreversibly committed to the blockchain within seconds. The added
 advantage is the communication trees to "(&#x2026;) optimize transaction commitments and verification under normal operations." (<a href="https://www.kudelskisecurity.com/sites/default/files/files/kudelski_Security_blockchain_20161213.pdf">2016 Kudelski Security report</a>).

Hyperledger reduces these security risks and ensures that only the parties that want to transact are the ones that are
 part of the transaction and, rather than displaying the record of the transactions to the whole network, they remain visible

<p>
Chain Core is an enterprise permissioned blockchain system that is mostly focused on financial services, like currencies, securities, derivatives, gift
 cards, and loyalty points. The company partners with clients to launch and operate a network under the client's brand. Thanks
 to its strategic partnerships with companies such as Capital One, Citigroup, Fiserv, Nasdaq, Orange, Visa, etc., the company raised over $40 million in funding since 2014.
</p>

<p>
Within the Chain Core network, the creation and transfer of assets is decentralized. However, as stated in the <a href="https://www.kudelskisecurity.com/sites/default/files/files/kudelski_Security_blockchain_20161213.pdf">2016 Kudelski Security report</a>,
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
"the operation of the network is governed by a designated set of entities known as a federation".
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
The platform features the Chain Testnet, which allows decentralized application development on Chain Core, operated by Chain, Microsoft, and the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3).

<h4 id="sec-4-12-2"><span class="section-number-4">4.12.2</span> Corda</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-12-2">
<p>
As of September 2017, R3 is a consortium of over one hundred large global financial institutions, that seeks to leverage
 distributed ledger technologies to record, manage, and automate legal agreements between businesses through its software solution, called Corda.
</p>

<p>
Corda is a distributed ledger platform, which features a blockchain-style P2P network; however, it is not a blockchain platform
. Unlike blockchains, which involve global availability of data across the network and third party validators, Corda only allows information access
 and validation functions to parties actually involved in the transaction. Featuring a different software architecture, "Corda achieves consensus between firms
 at the level of individual deals, not the level of the system" (<a href="http://www.r3cev.com/blog/2016/4/4/introducing-r3-corda-a-distributed-ledger-designed-for-financial-services">Richard Gendal Brown</a>, 2016), while supporting a variety of consensus mechanisms.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-12-3">
<p>
Created by JPMorgan, Quorum is, in fact, a fork of the Ethereum public blockchain, which uses a voting-based consensus
 algorithm to facilitate an enterprise-focused distributed ledger and smart contract platform. Data privacy is achieved within the network by
 allowing data visibility on a need-to-know basis. The platform is designed to support "both transaction-level privacy and
 network-wide transparency" (<a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/country/US/EN/Quorum">jpmorgan.com</a>). The network validates all smart contracts and overall system state through the involvement of all
 running nodes. As with other permissioned ledgers, regulatory compliance is front and center in the Quorum platform.

<h4 id="sec-4-12-4"><span class="section-number-4">4.12.4</span> IOTA</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-12-4">
<p>
The cryptocurrency IOTA has been around since 2015. According to 
<a href="https://medium.com/@MartinRosulek/how-iota-makes-future-for-internet-of-things-af14fd77d2a3">Martin Rosulek</a>, "It is the first cryptocurrency
 that provides the whole ecosystem based on blockless blockchain" to enable machine-to-machine (M2M) transactions.
</p>

<p>
IOTA, however, is more than just a cryptocurrency. Essentially, the platform entails a generalization of the blockchain protocol (the technology
 called Tangle) that sits at the backend of the IOTA platform. 
</p>

<p>
Instead of paying miners to validate the transactions, the architecture of the network involves peer-based validation. We can think
 of a simple analogy, that of a teacher grading students' homework: the students are the clients/users in the Bitcoin
 protocol, and the teacher is the miner/validator. Tangle technology asks students (users) to grade each other's homework, making the
 need for a teacher (external validator) redundant, and avoiding expenses related to the teacher's/validator's work. This allows the platform
 to be completely free of cost, without facing the scaling challenges that are inherent in the first generation of blockchains.

<h3 id="sec-4-13"><span class="section-number-3">4.13</span> Challenges in the Adoption/Deployment of Distributed Ledger Technologies</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-13">
<p>
There are a number of challenges to the widespread use of permissioned distributed ledger technologies. Key among them are challenges
 around the lack of standards, regulatory challenges, and the lack of knowledge about distributed ledger technologies. These challenges are inherent
 to any new technological infrastructure that replaces an older infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
We hope you go on to address some of these challenges and contribute to building a secure digital future!
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-13-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-13-1"><span class="section-number-4">4.13.1</span> Standards</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-13-1">
<p>
Since we are still witnessing the early days of blockchain technology, there is no agreement on standards in the developer
 and business community, as of yet. Standards are key in ensuring interoperability and avoiding risks associated with a fragmented ecosystem
. Standards are critical not just for the distributed ledger itself, but also for supporting services, like identity, privacy, and data
 governance. Furthermore, the management of keys, as well as protocols and standards around key loss and theft, will be critical
 (<a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/PageFiles/508003/BSI_Blockchain_DLT_Web.pdf">Deshpande, Stewart, Lepetit, &amp; Gunashekar</a>, 2017).
</p>


<p>
As a result, the International Organization for Standardization for Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies was established in 2016 and has
 defined areas for future standardization work (<a href="https://www.iso.org/news/Ref2188.htm">Clare Naden</a>, 2017). More about the ISO/TC 307 technical committee can be found
 at <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/6266604.html">https://www.iso.org/committee/6266604.html</a>.

<h4 id="sec-4-13-2"><span class="section-number-4">4.13.2</span> Regulation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-13-2">
<p>
The lack of regulation around transactions on the blockchain creates an environment of uncertainty for all players. Highly regulated industries
 like financial services are treading carefully in the DLT space. The Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States has
 recently clarified its stance (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_coinofferings">sec.gov</a>) on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The Chinese government has, in fact, banned all ICOs
, while 60 major ICO platforms are being investigated (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/04/chinese-icos-china-bans-fundraising-through-initial-coin-offerings-report-says.html">Saheli Roy Choudhury</a>, 2017).
</p>

<p>
Similarly, there are no regulatory guidelines governing smart contracts, causing much anxiety among various players like lawyers, regulators, programmers, and
 businesses. The lack of regulatory guidelines, along with a lack of industry standards, exacerbates hindrances to rapid adoption of DLT.

<h4 id="sec-4-13-3"><span class="section-number-4">4.13.3</span> Lack of Know-How</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-13-3">
<p>
The lack of know-how (and know-whom and know-where) around distributed ledger technologies and the availability of experts
 in the area is a major challenge in the adoption of distributed ledger technologies. While there has been an exponential
 increase in the interest around 'blockchain', as indicated in the figure below, there is a huge lag of technical talent
 in the space. In fact, the origin of this course stems from the need to address this gap in know-how, both for the business and technical audiences.

<h3 id="sec-4-14"><span class="section-number-3">4.14</span> Conclusion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-14">
<p>
For a new technology to realize its full potential, a lot of pieces need to exist before network effects can
 be realized. Moreover, in order for the technology to bring in systemic efficiencies, a critical mass needs to be attained
. As an infrastructure technology, all major players in the market need to collaborate to define standards in a democratic manner
. The blockchain community is indeed witnessing unprecedented levels of industry collaboration between players who are otherwise competitors in the space
. Because of the cost of moving from one infrastructure technology to the next, an open source collaborative approach is the
 most promising way forward. As you will learn in Chapter 2, Introduction to Hyperledger, Hyperledger's mandate is to develop and
 nurture this ecosystem to develop the future of business blockchain technologies.
