<h4 id="sec-4-1-1"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.1</span> Background - The Rising Interest in Distributed Ledger Technologies</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-1">
<p>
Looking back to the last half century of computer technologies and architectures, one may observe a trend of fluctuation between the centralization and subsequent decentralization of computing power, storage, infrastructure, protocols, and code.
</p>

<p>
Mainframe computers are largely centralized. They typically house all computing power, memory, data storage, and code. Access to mainframes is mainly by 'dumb terminals', which only take inputs and outputs, and do not store or process data.
</p>

<p>
With the advent of personal computers and private networks, similar computational capabilities were now housed both on the clients, as well as the servers. This, in part, gave rise to the 'client-server' architecture, which supported the development of relational database systems. Massive data sets, which are housed on mainframes, could move onto a distributed architecture. This data could replicate from server to server, and subsets of the data could be accessed and processed on clients, and then, synced back to the server.
</p>

<p>
Over time, Internet and cloud computing architectures enabled global access from a variety of computing devices; whereas mainframes were largely designed to address the needs of large corporations and governments. Even though this 'cloud architecture' is decentralized in terms of hardware, it has given rise to application-level centralization (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc).
</p>

<p>
Currently, we are witnessing the transition from centralized computing, storage, and processing to decentralized architectures and systems. According to <a href="https://medium.com/@muneeb/the-next-wave-of-computing-743295b4bc73">Muneeb Ali</a>, these systems aim to
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"give explicit control of digital assets to end-users and remove the need to trust any third-party servers and infrastructure".
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Distributed ledger technology is one of the key innovations making this shift possible.

<h4 id="sec-4-1-2"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.2</span> Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-2">
<p>
A <b>distributed ledger</b> is a type of data structure which resides across multiple computer devices, generally spread across locations or regions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Distributed Ledger Technology</b> includes blockchain technologies and smart contracts. While distributed ledgers existed prior to Bitcoin, the Bitcoin blockchain marks the convergence of a host of technologies, including timestamping of transactions, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, cryptography, and shared computational power, along with a new consensus algorithm. 
</p>

<p>
In summary, distributed ledger technology generally consists of <a href="https://intelledger.github.io/introduction.html">three basic components</a>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A <b>data model</b> that captures the current state of the ledger
</li>
<li>A <b>language of transactions</b> that changes the ledger state
</li>
<li>A <b>protocol</b> used to build consensus among participants around which transactions will be accepted, and in what order, by the ledger.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-1-3"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.3</span> Blockchains</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-3">
<p>
According to <a href="https://hyperledger.org/about">hyperledger.org</a>,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"A blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger forged by consensus, combined with a system for "smart contracts" and other assistive technologies."
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Smart contracts</b> are simply computer programs that execute predefined actions when certain conditions within the system are met.
</li>

<li><b>Consensus</b> refers to a system of ensuring that parties agree to a certain state of the system as the true state.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Blockchain</b> is a specific form or subset of distributed ledger technologies, which constructs a chronological chain of <b>blocks</b>, hence the name 'block-chain'. A block refers to a set of transactions that
 are bundled together and added to the chain at the same time. In the Bitcoin blockchain, the miner nodes bundle unconfirmed and valid transactions into a block. 
Each block contains a given number of transactions. In the Bitcoin network, miners must solve a cryptographic challenge to propose the next block. This process is
 known as '<b>proof of work</b>', and requires significant computing power. We shall discuss proof of work in more detail in the Consensus Algorithms section. For a brief history of blockchain technology, please <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-brief-history-of-blockchain">click here</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Timestamping</b> is another key feature of blockchain technology. Each block is timestamped, with each new block referring to the previous block. Combined with <b>cryptographic hashes</b>, this timestamped chain of blocks provides an immutable record of all transactions in the network, from the very first (or genesis) block.
</p>

<p>
A block commonly consists of four pieces of metadata:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The reference to the previous block
</li>
<li>The proof of work, also known as a nonce
</li>
<li>The timestamp
</li>
<li>The Merkle tree root for the transactions included in this block.
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1-4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-1-4"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.4</span> Merkle Tree</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-4">
<p>
The Merkle tree, also known as a binary hash tree, is a data structure that is used to store hashes of the individual data in large datasets in a way to make the verification of the dataset efficient. 
It is an <b>anti-tamper mechanism</b> to ensure that the large dataset has not been changed. The word 'tree' is used to refer to a branching data structure in computer science, as seen in the image below. 
According to Andreas M. Antonopoulos, in the Bitcoin protocol,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Merkle trees are used to summarize all the transactions in a block, producing an overall digital fingerprint of the entire set of transactions, providing a very efficient process to verify whether a transaction is included in a block."

<h4 id="sec-4-1-5"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.5</span> Transactions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-5">
<p>
The record of an event, cryptographically secured with a digital signature, that is verified, ordered, and bundled together into blocks, 
form the <b>transactions</b> in the blockchain. In the Bitcoin blockchain, transactions involve the transfer of bitcoins, while in other blockchains,
transactions may involve the transfer of any asset or a record of some service being rendered. Furthermore, a smart contract
within the blockchain may allow automatic execution of transactions upon meeting predefined criteria.
</p>


<p>
<b>Cryptography</b> has a key role to play both in the security, as well as in the immutability of the transactions
 recorded on blockchains. Cryptography is the study of the techniques used to allow secure communication between different parties and to
 ensure the authenticity and immutability of the data being communicated. For blockchain technologies, cryptography is used to prove that a
 transaction was created by the right person. It is also used to link transactions into a block in a tamper-proof way, as well as create the links between blocks, to form a blockchain.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1-6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-1-6"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.6</span> Differences between Blockchains and Databases</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-6">
<p>
Blockchain technology has some key differentiators from databases. 
</p>

<p>
A blockchain is a write-only data structure, where new entries get appended onto the end of the ledger. Every
 new block gets appended to the block chain by linking to the previous block's 'hash'.
 There are no administrator permissions within a blockchain that allow editing or deleting of data.
</p>

<p>
In a relational database, data can be easily modified or deleted. Typically, there are database administrators who may make changes
 to any part of the data and/or its structure. Additionally, blockchains were designed for decentralized applications, whereas relational databases
, in general, were originally designed for centralized applications, where a single entity controls the data.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1-7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-1-7"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.7</span> Types of Blockchains</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-7">
<p>
A blockchain can be both <b>permissionless</b> (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) or <b>permissioned</b> (like the different Hyperledger blockchain frameworks). A permissionless
 blockchain is also known as a public blockchain, because anyone can join the network. A permissioned blockchain, or private blockchain
, requires pre-verification of the participating parties within the network, and these parties are usually known to each other.
</p>

<p>
The choice between permissionless versus permissioned blockchains should be driven by the particular application at hand (or use case). Most
 enterprise use cases involve extensive vetting before parties agree to do business with each other. An example where a number
 of businesses exchange information is the supply chain management. The supply chain management is an ideal use case for permissioned
 blockchains. You would not want non-vetted companies participating in the network. Each participant that is involved in the supply
 chain would require permissions to execute transactions on the blockchain. These transactions would allow other companies to understand where in
 the supply chain a particular item is. 
</p>

<p>
On the contrary, when a network can 'commoditize' trust, facilitating parties to transact without necessarily having to verify each other's
 identity, like the Bitcoin blockchain, a permissionless blockchain is more suitable. Many of these instances involve the sale or distribution
 to the public. Cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (which are not backed by national governments) usually involve implementations of permissionless blockchains.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1-8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-1-8"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.8</span> Peer-to-Peer Network Architecture</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-8">
<p>
Historically, most applications utilize a central server (or servers). For one user/client to send a message to another user/client
 in the network, the request has to be sent to the hub or a central server, which then directs it to the right computer.
</p>

<p>
<b>Peer-to-peer</b> (P2P) networks were first made popular by Napster (and later BitTorrent) and consist of computer systems which
 are directly connected to each other via the Internet, without a central server. Peers contribute to the computing power and
 storage that is required for the upkeep of the network. P2P networks are generally considered to be more secure than
 centralized networks, as they do not have a single point of attack, as in the case of a server-based
 network, where the security of the entire network can be compromised if the central server is successfully attacked. As a
 result, large corporations invest significant amounts of financial resources to fortify their central servers, and yet, a total cost of
 $445 billion to the global economy in cyberspace crimes was estimated by the World Economic Forum's <a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-risks-report-2016">2016 Global Risk Report</a>.
</p>

<p>
Permissionless P2P systems do not require a set amount of peers to be online and are generally slower. Permissioned P2P
 networks have to guarantee uptime and require a high level of quality of service on the communication links.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1-9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-1-9"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.9</span> Immutability of Data</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-9">
<p>
The immutability of the data which sits on the blockchain is perhaps the most powerful and convincing reason to deploy
 blockchain-based solutions for a variety of socio-economic processes which are currently recorded on centralized servers. This <b>immutability</b>, or '<b>unchanging over time</b>' feature
 makes the blockchain useful for accounting, financial transactions, identity management, and asset ownership, management and transfer, just
 to name a few examples. Once a transaction is written onto the blockchain, no one can change it, or, at least, it would be extremely difficult to change it.
</p>

<p>
According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gentle-introduction-immutability-blockchains-antony-lewis/">Antony Lewis</a>, the Director of Research at R3, 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"When people say that blockchains are immutable, they don't mean that the data can't be changed, they mean it is extremely hard to change without collusion, and if you try, it's extremely easy to detect the attempt."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Let's dig into this statement a bit further. It is extremely hard to change the transactions in a blockchain, because
 each block is linked to the previous block by including the previous block's hash. This hash includes the Merkle root
 hash of all the transactions in the previous block. If a single transaction were to change, not only would the
 Merkle root hash change, but so too would the hash contained in the changed block. In addition, each subsequent block
 would need to be updated to reflect this change. In the case of proof of work, the amount of energy
 required to recalculate the nonce for this block and each subsequent block would be prohibitive. On the other hand, if
 someone did modify a transaction in a block without going through the necessary steps to update the subsequent blocks, it
 would be easy to recalculate the hashes used in the blocks and determine that something is amiss.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at an example of how this works. In the following diagram, we see the original blocks and the
 transactions for Block 11. Specifically, we see that the Merkle root for the transactions in Block 11 is <b>Hash #ABCD</b>, which
 is the combined hash for the four transactions in this block. Now, let's say that someone comes in and attempts
 to change Transaction A to Transaction A'. This, in turn, modifies the hashes that are stored in the Merkle tree, and the Merkle root changes to <b>Hash #A'BCD</b>.
 In addition, the Previous Block hash stored in Block 12 also needs to be modified to reflect the overall change in the hash for Block 11.

Since blockchain is a new form of digital infrastructure, applications built on top of a blockchain provide a gateway to
 accessing information that sits on that blockchain. In other words, clients/users interact with the blockchain through applications. Starting from
 the simple wallets that hold bitcoins, sophisticated applications which encompass applications addressing digital identity (e.g. UPort, KYC-Chain, Netki, etc.), and
 complex financial transactions are being built on the blockchain.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-12">
<p>
With the invention of the peer-to-peer (P2P) cash system known as Bitcoin in 2008, we have an example
 of a global decentralized payment network with a distributed and publicly-owned infrastructure, operating as a 'permissionless' system. There is
 a persuasive case that Bitcoin is the first 'killer application' of decentralized computing. One can send and receive bitcoins anywhere
 in the world in a completely P2P manner, without having to intermediate through a trusted third party, such as a bank.
</p>



<p>
According to the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">Coin Market Capitalizations</a> website, as of October 2017, bitcoin's market capitalization (market cap) was nearly $100 billion.

<p>
According to <a href="https://angel.co/blockchains">AngelList</a>, more than one thousand startups have been created to leverage Bitcoin and blockchain-related technologies since the
 inception of the Bitcoin payment system. Hundreds of large companies, and dozens of governments and universities have become actively involved
 in researching, testing, and prototyping blockchain protocols, platforms, and applications. In particular, the financial services sector has been actively investing
 in exploring wider applications of distributed ledger technologies (of which, blockchain is a subset) since late 2015.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-13">
<p>
Bitcoin has also ushered in tremendous academic and research interest in the area of Cryptoeconomics and Cryptoeconomic security.
</p>

<p>
According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKqdjaH1dRo">Vitalik Buterin</a>,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Cryptoeconomics is about building systems that have certain desired properties using cryptography to prove properties about messages that happened in
 the past while using economic incentives defined inside the system to encourage desired properties to hold into the future."
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
In other words, the field of Cryptoeconomics explores the intersection of cryptography and economic incentives. While cryptography is used for
 ensuring network security at various levels and functions, the built-in economic incentives provided to the participating nodes in the
 network ensures that, at any given point, the majority of players in the network operate in a desirable way.
</p>


<p>
Rather than imposing barriers to entry, permissionless blockchains are public and open for anyone to join. Since such networks can
 reasonably expect all kind of agents - including malicious actors - the key lies in incentivizing good behavior in a critical majority of the network, such that:
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The malicious actors cannot take over the network through an <b>escalated attack</b>.
</li>
<li>The malicious actors cannot <b>collude</b> to undertake an organized majority attack on the network.
</li>
<li>The <b>payoffs</b> of securing the network are consistently higher than the cost of attacking the network.
</li>
<li>The <b>cost</b> of attacking the network is prohibitively high.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-14">
<p>
According to <a href="http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html">Ethereum's official documentation</a>,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Ethereum is an open blockchain platform that lets anyone build and use <b>decentralized applications</b> that run on blockchain technology".
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
The Ethereum blockchain platform facilitates <b>scripting functionality</b>, or '<b>smart contracts</b>', which are run through the nodes in the network. As
 a result, unlike the Bitcoin blockchain, it does not just track transactions, it also programs them. Technically, Ethereum is a
 Turing-complete virtual machine with its native cryptocurrency called 'ether'. The platform was proposed in 2013 in a white paper by the then 19-year old Vitalik Buterin.
</p>

<p>
As of October 2017, Ethereum had a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">market cap</a> of over $28 billion, making ether the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.

<p>
As the second best known public blockchain after the Bitcoin blockchain, Ethereum has ushered in an era of unprecedented activity around blockchain and distributed ledger technology.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the Ethereum public blockchain, there are numerous versions of Ethereum which are designed to be private and are permissioned.

<h4 id="sec-4-1-15"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.15</span> Dapps</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-15">
<p>
As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clw-qf1sUZg">Stephan Tual</a> explains, Ethereum applications do not have a middleman; instead, users interact in a P2P fashion with other
 users through a variety of interfaces - social, financial, gaming, etc. Since the applications are developed on the decentralized consensus-based
 network itself, third-party censorship is virtually impossible. Malicious actors cannot secretly tamper with the application by changing the code
 and compromise all application users (or nodes that are actively interacting with it). These <i>Decentralized Applications</i> have come to be known as <b>Dapps</b>.
</p>

<p>
Since they are cryptographically secured, Dapps are referred to as 'secure applications'. Some of the <a href="http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/web3.html">high profile Dapps</a> built on the Ethereum platform include:
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Augur</b>, which is a Decentralized Prediction Market. Learn more at <a href="https://augur.net/">https://augur.net/</a>.
</li>
<li><b>Digix</b>, which tokenizes gold on Ethereum. Learn more at: <a href="https://digix.global/">https://digix.global/</a>.
</li>
<li><b>Maker</b>, which is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Learn more at: <a href="https://makerdao.com/">https://makerdao.com/</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Ethereum network is a distributed global public network, which means it is not run on central servers in a
 certain geographical location. Instead, the computing power that runs the network is contributed by nodes that are spread across the
 globe. In other words, Dapps have 'zero downtime' - they never go down and, in general, cannot be switched off.
